# pythonPhotoOrganizer

## Works on small, local drives
Go into a photo library, detect existing photos/videos and automatically sort them into the following file structure:
* Year
* Month
* Filetype(Photo and Video)

## Using the app:
* Never use python, so I'll just say: you might have to install some of the required frameworks, including 'pillow' 
* Ignore the opening prompt, just hit 'y' to the SSH q (This app is only working with local drives anyway)
* Copy in the path to the main file tree
* Hit enter, watch for notes (I'm leaving some debug writelines in)

## Next up
* Figure out how to run via Docker
* Otherways to deploy this... can this just sit in photo library somewhere and run if it needs to in the background?
